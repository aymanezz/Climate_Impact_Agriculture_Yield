## Introduction
This project aims to understand how various climate factors such as temperature, precipitation, and sea level changes impact agricultural yield. The analysis includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and building predictive models.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the datasets used in this project.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and model development.
- `src/`: Python scripts for data processing and model training.
- `docs/`: Documentation and references.
- `results/`: Outputs and model evaluation results.

## Data Sources
- Climate data from [FAOSTAT].
- Agricultural yield data from [European Space Agency (ESA)].
- Sea level data from [NOAA].

Refer to the `data/` folder for detailed descriptions of the datasets used.
