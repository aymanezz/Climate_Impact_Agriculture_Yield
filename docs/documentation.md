## Steps and Methodology

### 1. Data Collection and Cleaning
- **Step 1**: Downloaded datasets from various sources and organized them into the `data/` directory.
- **Step 2**: Ensured that all data files are in CSV format for consistency and ease of use.
- **Step 3**: Created a directory structure within the project repository to manage the datasets.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM
- **Time Series Analysis**: Statsmodels, TensorFlow/Keras (for LSTM)
- **Dashboarding**: Dash, Streamlit, Tableau
- **Data Sources**: NOAA, NASA, FAO, USDA, and other agricultural databases

## Next Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handle missing values and anomalies in the datasets.
   - Standardize and preprocess data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze historical trends in temperature, rainfall, and other climate variables.
   - Examine trends in agricultural yields over time.
   - Identify relationships between climate variables and crop yields.
3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create indices such as average temperature, total rainfall during the growing season, etc.
   - Develop lag features to account for delayed effects of climate variables on crop yields.
   - Create interaction features between different climate variables.
4. **Modeling**:
   - Train regression models to predict crop yields based on climate data.
   - Implement time series analysis to forecast future climate trends and their impact on yields.
5. **Visualization and Dashboarding**:
   - Use visualizations to show historical trends in climate and yields.
   - Create plots to illustrate the impact of key climate variables on crop yields.
   - Develop an interactive dashboard to allow users to explore data and model predictions.
